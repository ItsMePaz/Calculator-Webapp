# Calculator

This is a simple Calculator including only the fundamental operations in mathematics (Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, and Division).

This project has been made by Michael Andrew T. Paz.

Visual Studio Code is used as the source-code editor

Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is used to create this.

-- Algorithm used in the planning and creation of this project --

1. Allow the user to input the digits of the 1st terms of the equation
2. If the user then clicks the desired operation, the screen will remove the inputs to give way for the 2nd part of the equation
3. If the user then clicks the '=' button, the screen will display the result. Else, if the user clicks any of the operators, assuming they want to go further with the equation, the program will retain the solution from the first two terms then it will operate it to the next desired values and this process will keep on looping until the user finally clicks the '=' which will end the retained values and will display the final solution.
